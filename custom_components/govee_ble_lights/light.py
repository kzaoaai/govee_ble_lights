"""
This class represents Govee light entities.
It only contains the basic methods, and uses govee_ble to talk to govee devices.

This module implements Home Assistant light entities that control Govee BLE lights.
It provides:

1. Device connection management via BLE
2. Light state control (on/off, brightness, color)
3. Scene/effect playback
4. State monitoring via BLE notifications
5. Model-specific handling (segmented vs non-segmented, percentage vs absolute brightness)

The entity uses the GoveeBLE class for all protocol operations and maintains its
own BLE connection with keepalive background tasks.
