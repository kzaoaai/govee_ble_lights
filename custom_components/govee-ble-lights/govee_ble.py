"""
This file contains all functionality pertaining to Govee BLE lights, including data structures.

This module implements the complete protocol for communicating with Govee BLE LED lights.
The protocol is based on reverse-engineering and uses custom binary packet formats
rather than standard Bluetooth GATT characteristics.

The implementation handles:
- BLE connection management and keepalive
- Power control (on/off)
- Brightness control (with percentage support for newer models)
- Color control (RGB)
- Scene/effect playback (not supported yet)
- Multi-packet support for segmented light strips

    This class is used to connect to and control Govee branded LED lights.

    The Govee BLE protocol uses custom packet formats that differ from standard
    Bluetooth GATT. Packets have:
    - A frame type byte
    - Command byte indicating the operation
    - Variable payload data
    - 19-byte data section (zero-padded)
    - XOR checksum byte for integrity verification

    The implementation:
    1. Establishes connections using bleak with retry logic
    2. Creates background keepalive tasks to prevent connection drops
    3. Sends commands via characteristic writes
    4. Handles notifications for state changes
    5. Supports multi-packet commands for segmented strips

        Background task that ensures a light's BLE connection stays active.

        This method is called as a background task.
        It continuously sends keepalive packets to prevent connection drops
        and ensures responsive light control.

            client: BleakClient instance to keep alive

        The keepalive loop:
        1. Waits 1 second (BLE_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL)
        2. Ensures client is connected (reconnects if needed)
        3. Sends a keepalive packet
        4. Continues indefinitely until stopped (homeassistant shutdown or device removed)

        The try-except block prevents exceptions from stopping the loop,
        which would cause the connection to die.

        0xaa is a known documented header type to describe a keepalive packet.
